# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
yarn hardhat help
yern hardhat test

to run on test net - 'yarn hardhat deploy --network goerli'
to deploy both mocks and real contract - 'yarn hardhat deploy'
